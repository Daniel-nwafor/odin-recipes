    <h2>fresh cranberry</h2>
    <img src="image/cran.jpeg" alt="cranberry-img">
    <p>Opt for fresh cranberries that are firm, plump, and blemish-free.</p>
    <P>lighter colored cranberries are best for sauce, as they contain more</P> 
    <p>pectin and result in a thicker consistency.</p>
    <h2>orange juice</h2>
    <img src="image/orange.jpeg" alt="orange juice-img">
    <p>All cranberry sauce starts with a liquid base. If you don't like orange juice,</p>
    <p>you can substitute pomegranate juice or even red wine.</p>
    <h2>sugar</h2>
    <img src="image/sugar.jpeg" alt="sugar-img">
    <p>White sugar does more than add sweetness to classic cranberry sauce:</p>
    <p>It also absorbs liquid and, when heated, thickens the sauce.</p>
